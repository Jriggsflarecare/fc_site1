            My journey with IBD began when I was diagnosed with Left-sided Colitis, which eventually progressed to severe Pancolitis. 
            For three grueling years, I experienced the full impact of this devastating disease - two hospitalizations, countless ER visits due to dehydration, 
            and the daily struggle that anyone with IBD knows all too well.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            I tried everything to manage my UC. Each day was a new battle, not just with the physical symptoms, but with the uncertainty 
            and fear that comes with this condition. It wasn't until I found the right biologic medication that I finally began to see 
            the light at the end of the tunnel.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            After achieving remission and becoming steroid-free, I made a decision: I wanted to help others who were going through 
            the same struggle. I knew firsthand how isolating and overwhelming IBD can be, and I believed there had to be a better 
            way to track, manage, and understand this condition.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            That's when FlareCare was born. As a father to my amazing 2-year-old son Easton, I'm reminded every day of why this 
            mission is so important. Easton is my 'why' - he shows me the importance of being present, healthy, and able to fully 
            engage in life's precious moments.
